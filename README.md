# Number Guessing Game Using GUI

## Overview
This is an implementation of a Random number guessing game written in Python using tkinter to generate a GUI. The program generates a random number from a selected range that the user inputs. First, the user is prompted to enter their desired range for the randomizer in the input field. The user is then prompted to enter their guess for what the random number might be. The program then proceeds to display how many tires, in general, it would take to guess the random number using Binary search. Afterwhich, the program will determine if the user guessed number is, in fact, the random number, higher than the random number or lower than the random number. If the user's guess is wrong, the user is prompted to continue or quit. Once the user guesses the number, the program will display the number of tries it takes to guess the number.
